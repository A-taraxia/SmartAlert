Android Emergency Application

An advanced Android application that was developed as a university assignment for the subject of Software Engineering. The app is based on Google's Firebase platform. Users are able to easily authenticate with their Google accounts. Real time chat with a hypothetical licensed doctor, in-app and system wide alerts on major catastrophic events, a panic button for emergency calls, a driving mode that notifies of speeding violations and a disability mode for fall detection. This software was developed in phases based on RUP with detailed UML diagrams.
